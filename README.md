# asSeq2Int

asSeq2Int is a python-based code that takes sequences of interest (SoI) and proteins of interest (PoI) as inputs and outputs proteins that contains the SoI that interacts with the PoI.

# For CIBR final project submission
asSeq2Int will be incomplete at the time of submission with only 2 of the 6 functions implement
However, the submitted parts will be able to take user inputs and output results as a .csv (in the full code, it will output directly into the next part of the code as a list).
Instructions for CIBR course instructors are included in a section below

# Instructions for CIBR final project testing
The submitted code will take a amino acid sequence of interest as a user input.
It will then output a .csv that list proteins (included in the FASTA file) that conntain your sequence of interest.

A dummy FASTA dataset has been created for testing purposes.

Recomended Sequence of interest input:
<TO BE ADDED>

But the code should be able to take any sequence of interest. So feel free to test it out!

## Version


0.2.0 Part 1 function implemented: FASTA file can be reformatted into a list for Part 2
